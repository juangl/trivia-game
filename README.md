# Trivia Game

this is a challenge for G2i. In this project I decided to make some experiments inspired by other technologies such as Remex and use some technologies that I have never used such as `Fastify`.

js takes time to run  SSR comes in


faster reload. It only needs to reload the run.ts manually

other software makes its trade off, other options should exists not because the can't or they shouldn't. 
## Instructions

## Technology description

### React 17 JSX Factories

This project is using the [new React 17 JSX Transform](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html). This is an experimental Typescript feature so you may need to enable editor support as described [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/typescript#_how-can-i-use-the-latest-typescript-beta-with-vs-code).
